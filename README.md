# CSCE320-QBAnalysis

Welcome to our project. To view the work we did successfully, please open our python notebook file in your preferred editor. Also, make sure you have our csv files in the same directory to our notebook can process them.

Once you are all set up, run all the cells, or start from the top and run each cell. For our KNN analysis, there will be user input that will ask you to input the name of the quarterback. We did not do any form of error checking, so please type the name of the quarterback you wish to analyze accurately. This should be our only user input, everything else will display to the screen once the cells are run, enjoy!
